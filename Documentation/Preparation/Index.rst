Preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned before, this tutorial uses two main files, an HTML template and a CSS file.
We will be editing and working on the HTML template during this tutorial.
You need the CSS file, but you will not need to
edit it during this tutorial. As we progress in our learning, you will need them to reproduce
the tasks demonstrated here in your own installation.
You will receive instructions on how to install them on your own website using the Extension Manager.
