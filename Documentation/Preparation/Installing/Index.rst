Installing the extension
""""""""""""""""""""""""

To get all the needed files, please download this extension and install it into
your TYPO3 installation; do not only view it in the TYPO3 Extension Repository
(TER) or online at typo3.org. By installing it you directly have all the needed
template files (HTML, CSS and the TypoScript in an textfile) on your system.

(If you have already done that, you can skip the rest of this chapter.).

.. note::
   The extension key of this tutorial is "doc_tut_templating". Search for it in your extension manager
   and install it.

The extension is shown as "installed". Installing the extension is not
needed, but if installing worked for the user (which we can check easily), we
know that the files are in place for the next step.
