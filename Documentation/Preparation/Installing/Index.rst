Installing the extension
""""""""""""""""""""""""

To get all the needed files, please download this extension and install it into
your TYPO3 CMS installation. It is not enough to simply view it online in the TYPO3 CMS Extension Repository
(TER) or at docs.typo3.org. By installing it you gain access to the
template files (HTML, CSS and the TypoScript in a textfile) directly on your server and TYPO3 CMS system.

(If you have already done that, you can skip the rest of this chapter.)

.. note::

   The extension key of this tutorial is "doc_tut_templating". Search for it in your extension manager
   and install it.

The extension is shown as "installed". Installing the extension is not
needed, but if installing worked for the user (which we can easily check it), we
know that the files are in place for the next step.
