Creating a page structure
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

We now show you detailed, how to create that page structure. We are using the
Introduction Package for the screenshots, if you are using the blank package,
it is the same. Just ignore the already present "Home" and
"TypoScript-Templates"-Trees of the introduction package.

In the TYPO3 backend make sure you are in the page module by opening the section
"Web" in the left part of the Backend and by clicking the "Page" module in this
section.

Create a first page, which hierarchically is located directly below the TYPO3
logo at the top. We call this page "root" page.

1. Right-click on the logo of "New TYPO3 site", then left-click New.

2. Place the page at the bottom of the present pages/folders.

3. Change the page type to "Standard" and confirm that change. Give the page the
page Title "Root".

4. Switch to tab "Behaviour" in the palette "Miscellaneous".
Mark the checkbox "Use as root page"

5. Click "Save and close document". Now you see the new page with a globe icon in
the page tree:

   :alt: Active root page

Create a subpages, which hierarchically is located inside that root page.

6. Right-click on the root page and from the context menu select "Page Actions >
New".

   :alt: Create subpages

7. Place the new page hierarchically inside of the Root page.

.. figure:: ../../Images/TBT-page-structure-new-7.jpg
   :alt: Select position for a subpage

8. Give it the Page Title "Home". Switch to tab "Access" and uncheck the option "Visibility > Page
> Disable".

.. figure:: ../../Images/TBT-page-structure-new-8.jpg
   :alt: Customising the subpage

9. Click "Save and Close document".

Create some other subpages inside the root page in the same way. Place them on the
same level as the page "Home", but below it.

10. Switch into the page tree. Click on the small triangle in front of the page "Root".

Then you can see the complete page structure. Here is what the result might look
like:

In the upcoming window, you can select the target.

14. Choose the first page of the subpages. In our case this is the page, which we called "Home". Navigate there
by clicking the small triangles in front of the page names. Click on the page "Home".

.. figure:: ../../Images/TBT-page-structure-new-14.jpg
   :alt: Home becomes target for root page

15. Click "Save and close document" when you are back in the editing form from which you came.
