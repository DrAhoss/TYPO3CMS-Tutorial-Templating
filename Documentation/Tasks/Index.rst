^^^^^

In this tutorial we will use one of the most common approaches for building a website in TYPO3. 
We will adapt an HTML file to TYPO3, and it will be used as a basis for the website.
Certain changes will be made in this HTML template for it to work well with TYPO3. These changes will allow
certain parts, or segments, of this template to be replaced with the content,
which you have in your TYPO3 installation. To tell TYPO3 which parts it should replace,
our next step is to modify the HTML template. Inside it, we will add what we call "markers" and "subparts".
A suggestion would be to repeat these two words over and over again, as they are very important to keep in mind all
all throughout this tutorial.

In a later chapter we will configure TYPO3 to replace these markers and subparts with the content,
which has been inserted in TYPO3.
