In this tutorial we built the website by adding markers and 
subparts to a HTML file, which is a very common way to do the job.

to allow to create more flexible page structures.
However, both are not part of the TYPO3 Core and need some additional configuration. 
For these reasons they are not used in this tutorial.
* you can do without any HTML Template and build the website complete inside of 
Typoscript with nested COAs and wraps

Do you know that you can also create so called "references" instead of copying an object? 
If you want to know more, have a look at the manual "TypoScript Syntax and In-depth Study"! 
The chapter "Syntax" tells you all about the syntax of TypoScript!
