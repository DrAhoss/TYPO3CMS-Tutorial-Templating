In this tutorial you will learn how to build up a web-site with TYPO3.

The tutorial explains how to

- use an HTML document as a template for a website, which is run by TYPO3.

- integrate that HTML document into the TYPO3 system as a basis for all pages

- make TYPO3 insert the content of each page into that HTML template

- create text-based dynamic navigations (the menus on each page).

The result of the tutorial is a site similar to the Introduction Package.
The tutorial includes a set of files (mainly an HTML file and a CSS file),
which are used as an example troughout this tutorial.


.. _requirements:

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need an installed version of TYPO3 4.6 or higher. We recommanded the "Blank Package" as a basis.
It is downloadable from `here: <http://typo3.org/download/>`_.


.. _skill-level:

Skill level
^^^^^^^^^^^

You are a beginner as a site developer. This tutorial contains step by step instructions,
which enable you to create your first website with TYPO3, based on a given HTML file.

The job is to integrate a template into the TYPO3 system. This job is known as  "Integration" in the TYPO3 world.

Skills
^^^^^^

Please read the :ref:`TypoScript in 45 minutes tutorial <t3ts45:start>`  before you start.
It is enough if you have quickly read that document; you must not have understood everything
noted there (and surely not all the details). This tutorial should give you an overview of things in TYPO3.
However, we will also repeat things in the Templating Tutorial where they are needed.

Basic knowledge of HTML is needed (but no knowledge about details). Knowledge about CSS is not mandatory.


.. _what-s-new:

What's new
^^^^^^^^^^

This is the first version of this manual. It replaces the old "Modern Template Building Tutorial",
which was originally written in 2003. Although we have tested the descriptions in this manual,
there might still be places, which somehow are not clear or not understandable.

If something remains unclear when you are working through the manual, please drop us a note!

Either write us a mail to documentation@typo3.org or create a new issue in the issue tracker
of this manual at http://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3v4-doc_tut_templating/issues
(to create an issue you will need an account on typo3.org).

Thank you!
